=head1 NAME

App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple::File - a file-logger for App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides methods to App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple for logging to a file, and
viewing those log files.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This creates a new App::Sysadmin::Log::Simple::File object. It takes a hash of
options with keys:

=over 4

=item logdir

This specifies the top of the tree of log files. Default is F</var/log/sysadmin>.
Please note that unprivileged users are typically not permitted to create the
default log directory.

=item index_preamble

This is a string to place at the top of the index page.

=item view_preamble

This is a string to prepend when viewing the log files.

=item date

This is a DateTime object for when the log entry was made I<or> for specifying
which date's log file to view, depending on the mode of operation.

=back

=head2 view

This allows users to view a log file in a pager provided by L<IO::Pager>,
typically L<less(1)>.

=head2 log

This creates a new log file if needed, adds the log entry to it, and re-generates
the index file as necessary.
